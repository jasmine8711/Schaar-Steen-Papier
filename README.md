# Schaar-Steen-Papier [let's play](https://jasmine8711.github.io/Schaar-Steen-Papier/).

## Rock Paper Scissors game

This is my first game , i used javacript write the game, also used sass to style.

##Dom manipuationg
This is our tast to test how much i learned from last two weeks,which fouse on DOM manipulation.

##one day work
I used more than half day to write javascript code ,and the rest day i make the game looks nice and cute.

##How do i do it?

1. To create the start game page ,and make it jump to the game, i create two class names in css , and use javacript to add classlist and remove classlist .
1. First i creat three bottons to let the user choose rock paper scissors , and i also creat the random number of 0 ,1,2,to generate the computer choice.
1. Then I gave id to each element (rock ,paper ,scissors), and i get the id string of them, so i can compare the string, to find who wins.

##Pending things to do

1. Add animations when the game starts , so the hands can shake a little.
1. Now i realize there is problem, if i keep press the same botton, the scroe keep growing, so i think i need to fix that.
