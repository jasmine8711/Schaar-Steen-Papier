# Schaar-Steen-Papier [let's play](https://jasmine8711.github.io/Schaar-Steen-Papier/).

## Rock Paper Scissors game

This is the first game I made with javascript. To create the start game page, I toggle a class in javascript. You play against the computer who will select a random option. Then I gave an id to each element (rock, paper, scissors) so i can compare the string, to find who wins.

##Dom manipuationg
This is our tast to test how much i learned from last two weeks, which fouse on DOM manipulation.

##one day work
I used more than half day to write javascript code, and the rest of day i make the game looks nice and cute.

##How do i do it?

1. To create the start game page ,and make it jump to the game, i create two class styles in css , and use javacript to add classlist and remove classlist .
1. I creat three bottons to let the user choose rock, paper, scissors , and i also creat the random number of 0,1,2, to generate the computer's choice.
1. I gave id to each element(rock ,paper ,scissors), and i get the id string of them, so i can compare the string, to find who wins.

##Pending things to do

1. Add animations when the game starts , so the hands can shake a little.
